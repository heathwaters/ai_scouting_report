            <h1>Scouting Report: Max Freedman</h1><br><br><blockquote><strong>UTR Rating:<em>* 11.40 | **WTN:** 19.96 | **National Rank:** #154 | *</em>Division:</strong> Boys' 18 Singles</blockquote><br>><br><blockquote><strong>Head-to-Head Record:</strong> First Meeting</blockquote><br>><br><blockquote><strong>Recent Performance:</strong> Mixed results across the last 4 singles events over the past 2 months. Strong consolation run at Naples L2 (October) reaching C-F with a quality win over Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38), but early main draw exit at Evert ITF J60. Prior events show pattern of main draw losses followed by consolation withdrawals.</blockquote><br><br>---<br><br><h2>1. Performance Analytics</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Win/Loss Ratio:<em>* Max Freedman's overall record based on available match history is **15 wins and 10 losses** (excluding 6 walkovers and matches without scores). This represents a *</em>60% win rate</strong> across competitive matches. Current form shows he can string together wins against lower-rated opponents but faces challenges against players near or above his rating.</li><li><strong>Match Outcome Patterns:<em>* Max shows a clear pattern of **dominant wins against significantly lower-rated opponents** (e.g., 6-1 6-2 vs Francesco PADILLA (UTR: 8.59), 6-1 6-0 vs Ozzy West ODOM (UTR: 7.96)) but *</em>competitive, often extended matches against peers</strong>. When facing opponents within 0.5 UTR points of his rating, matches frequently go to three sets or tiebreaks, indicating he's a grinder at his level rather than a dominant force.</li><li><strong>Tiebreak & Clutch Performance:<em>* *</em>Current close-score vulnerability identified.</strong> In matches that went to deciding sets or match tiebreaks:</li></ul><br>  - Lost to James WAKEFIELD (UTR: 11.38): 6-2 4-6 [9-11]<br>  - Lost to Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38): 6-4 0-6 [6-10]<br>  - Lost to Andrew VINCLER (UTR: 10.78): 1-6 7-5 [9-11]<br>  - Lost to Caleb CHOW (UTR: 11.30): 7-5 6-7(13-15) [4-10]<br>  - Won vs Connor COLE (UTR: 11.14): 3-6 6-4 [11-9]<br>  - Won vs Alex BORBIU (UTR: 11.36): 6-2 5-7 6-1<br>  <br>  <strong>Current deciding set/tiebreak record: 2-4 (33% win rate).<em>* The overall trend suggests a player who is **currently struggling in close-score situations**, particularly in match tiebreaks. This represents a significant *</em>current window of opportunity</strong>—if you can extend matches and stay close, the data suggests he may tighten in the clutch moments.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>2. Competition Level Analysis (UTR FOCUSED)</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Current Level Ceiling (CRITICAL):</strong> </li></ul><br>  - <strong>Record vs 12.0+ UTR:</strong> 0-3 (0% win rate)<br>    - Lost to Rajat SHIRUR (UTR: 12.58): 2-6 2-6<br>    - Lost to Nischal SPURLING (UTR: 12.52): 1-6 3-6<br>    - Walkover received from Calvin BAIERL (UTR: 13.10) - not a competitive win<br>  - <strong>Record vs 11.5+ UTR:</strong> 0-5 (0% win rate)<br>    - Additional losses to Dhakshish ARYAN (UTR: 11.68): 3-6 4-6<br>    - Jens Holger NISSEN (UTR: 11.84): 5-7 7-6(7-5) 0-3 (Retirement)<br>    - Cristobal PLASENCIA ROBLES (UTR: 11.46): 3-6 2-6<br>  <br>  <strong>This indicates a current struggle to break through the 11.4-11.5 UTR band based on current results.<em>* Max has yet to record a competitive win against any opponent rated 11.5 or higher. This ceiling is a *</em>primary current vulnerability</strong>.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Performance vs Higher Rated Players:<em>* Record against opponents rated above 11.40 UTR is *</em>1-8</strong> (the one win being vs Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38) who is technically just below). Against opponents in the 11.40-11.50 range, he has shown competitiveness (close scores vs WAKEFIELD, RYBAK, CHOW) but consistently comes up short in decisive moments.</li><li><strong>Upset Losses (vs Lower UTR):</strong> Players with UTR at least 0.2 points below Max's 11.40 (i.e., ≤11.20 UTR):</li></ul><br>  <br>  1. <strong>Andrew VINCLER (UTR: 10.78)</strong> - 1-6 7-5 [9-11] - 2025-06-28 at Midland L2<br>     - <em>0.62 UTR points below Max - significant upset</em><br>  2. <strong>Carson KUCHAR (UTR: 10.91)</strong> - 3-6 4-6 - 2025-06-07 at Cincinnati ITF J30<br>     - <em>0.49 UTR points below Max - notable upset</em><br>  <br>  <strong>Current vulnerability when favored:<em>* Max has dropped matches to opponents rated nearly half a point below him. The VINCLER loss is particularly concerning as it was a match tiebreak loss after being up a break in the third, demonstrating the **close-score vulnerability** compounds when he's expected to win. This pattern suggests *</em>potential stress when favored</strong> against lower-rated opponents.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Round Performance:</strong></li></ul><br>  - <strong>Main Draw R128/R256:</strong> 3-1 (75%)<br>  - <strong>Main Draw R64:</strong> 1-1 (50%)<br>  - <strong>Main Draw R32:</strong> 1-3 (25%)<br>  - <strong>Main Draw R16:</strong> 0-2 (0%)<br>  - <strong>Consolation Rounds:</strong> 8-3 (73%)<br>  <br>  <strong>Current early-round vulnerability in main draws:<em>* Max struggles to advance past R32 in main draws at higher-level events. His best results come in consolation brackets where competition may be slightly softer. This represents a *</em>current vulnerability when facing the pressure of main draw advancement</strong>.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Top 2 Best Wins (Highest UTR):</strong></li></ul><br>  1. <strong>Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38)</strong> - 6-4 6-4 - 2025-10-13 (Naples L2 Consolation SF)<br>  2. <strong>Alex BORBIU (UTR: 11.36)</strong> - 6-2 5-7 6-1 - 2025-08-01 (Kalamazoo Nationals R256)<br><br><ul><li><strong>Top 2 Worst Losses (Lowest UTR - Upset Losses):</strong></li></ul><br>  1. <strong>Andrew VINCLER (UTR: 10.78)</strong> - 1-6 7-5 [9-11] - 2025-06-28 (Midland L2 R32)<br>  2. <strong>Carson KUCHAR (UTR: 10.91)</strong> - 3-6 4-6 - 2025-06-07 (Cincinnati ITF J30 R16)<br>  <br>  <em>These are losses to opponents Max should have been favored to beat based on ratings—current matches indicating vulnerability when expected to win.</em><br><br><ul><li><strong>Average Win/Loss Thresholds:</strong> </li></ul><br>  - <strong>Average UTR of opponents Max BEATS:</strong> ~10.45 (weighted toward sub-11.0 opponents)<br>  - <strong>Average UTR of opponents Max LOSES to:</strong> ~11.52<br>  - <strong>Current win ceiling:</strong> Approximately 11.38 UTR (his best win)<br>  - <strong>Current loss floor:</strong> 10.78 UTR (his worst loss)<br>  <br>  This gap between ceiling and floor indicates <strong>current inconsistency</strong>—he can beat players near his level on a good day but can also drop matches to significantly lower-rated opponents.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>3. Rating & Ranking Analytics</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Trajectory:<em>* Max's ranking has shown *</em>modest improvement</strong> over the past 6 months:</li></ul><br>  - May 2025: National #189<br>  - Current: National #154<br>  - UTR has remained stable at 11.40<br>  <br>  His ranking is improving faster than his UTR, which suggests he's accumulating points through volume and consolation runs rather than breakthrough wins. This trajectory is <strong>currently positive but not accelerating</strong>.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Ranking Efficiency:<em>* At #154 nationally with an 11.40 UTR, Max appears to be *</em>appropriately rated</strong>. However, his ranking may be slightly inflated by:</li></ul><br>  - Strong consolation performances (where competition is softer)<br>  - Points from L4 events (e.g., 540 points from Mexico L4 Open)<br>  - Bonus points from participation in L1/L2 events without deep main draw runs<br>  <br>  <strong>Current potential ranking inflation vulnerability:</strong> When facing players with similar rankings but higher UTRs, he may be outmatched.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Strength of Schedule:<em>* Max has faced a **moderately strong schedule** at L1-L3 events, but his wins come predominantly against opponents in the 9.5-11.0 UTR range. His 0-5 record against 11.5+ UTR opponents suggests he hasn't been tested successfully at the upper end of competition. *</em>Current vulnerability when stepping into fields with concentrated 11.5+ UTR players.</strong></li></ul><br><br>---<br><br><h2>4. Surface Performance</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Surface Preference:<em>* All available match data is on *</em>Hard courts</strong>. No clay or grass court data available for analysis.</li><li><strong>Adaptability:<em>* Cannot assess surface adaptability based on current data. However, his ranking points include an event in Mexico ("Torneo Juvenil") which may have been on different surfaces. *</em>No obvious surface-based vulnerability can be identified from current data</strong>, though his entire competitive sample is hard court based.</li></ul><br><br>---<br><br><h2>5. Point Defense & Stress Analysis</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Pressure/Stress Status:</strong> Based on the ranking snapshot, Max's top 6 counting events are:</li></ul><br>  - Key Biscayne L2 (May 2025): 791 points<br>  - Mexico L4 (April 2025): 540 points<br>  - Key Biscayne L2 (February 2025): 764 points<br>  - Naples L2 (October 2025): 611 points<br>  - Delray Championships (May 2025): 449 points<br>  - Kalamazoo Nationals (August 2025): 638 points<br>  <br>  The February and April events will begin dropping off in early 2026. <strong>Moderate stress of defending points</strong> in the coming months, particularly the 764 points from February Key Biscayne.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Current Stress Window:<em>* Combined with his recent Upset Losses (vs VINCLER, KUCHAR) and close-score struggles, Max may experience *</em>added pressure when trying to defend or replace points</strong>. The pattern of main draw losses followed by consolation runs suggests he feels the stress of needing results.</li><li><strong>Consolation / FIC Behavior:<em>* Max shows *</em>strong consolation performance</strong> (8-3 record, 73% win rate) compared to main draw struggles. This indicates:</li></ul><br>  - He competes hard after main draw losses (resilience strength)<br>  - He may perform better with reduced pressure/expectations<br>  - <strong>Current vulnerability:</strong> May not bring the same intensity to main draws where stakes are higher<br><br>---<br><br><h2>6. Temporal & Scheduling Analytics</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Activity Level:<em>* Max has been *</em>moderately active</strong> with events approximately every 3-4 weeks. He's match-tough with consistent tournament exposure.</li><li><strong>Fatigue & Rust Factors:</strong> </li></ul><br>  - <strong>Potential fatigue pattern:</strong> The retirement against Jens Holger NISSEN (UTR: 11.84) on July 9 (0-3 in deciding set after splitting sets with a tiebreak) occurred during a heavy summer schedule (Delray Clay Courts → Midland → Kalamazoo within 4 weeks).<br>  - <strong>Walkover pattern:</strong> 6 walkovers in the match history (both given and received) suggest some scheduling/physical management issues.<br>  - <strong>Current vulnerability:</strong> In back-to-back event weeks or deep in tournaments, physical/mental fatigue may compound his close-score struggles.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>7. Strategic Pattern Recognition</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Tournament Selection:<em>* Max plays a *</em>balanced mix</strong> of L1-L4 events:</li></ul><br>  - L1: Kalamazoo Nationals, Clay Court Nationals (high-level exposure)<br>  - L2: Key Biscayne, Naples, Midland (point accumulation)<br>  - L3: Bobby Curtis, Altamonte Springs, ITF J60s (competitive matches)<br>  - L4: Mexico Open (points in softer field)<br>  <br>  He's not avoiding tough competition but is also supplementing with L4 events. <strong>Current vulnerability:</strong> His L4 result (540 points) represents a significant portion of his ranking from a softer field.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Consistency:<em>* Max shows *</em>"boom/bust" tendencies</strong>:</li></ul><br>  - Can dominate lower-rated opponents (6-1 6-0 type scores)<br>  - Can also lose in straight sets to peers (3-6 2-6 vs PLASENCIA ROBLES)<br>  - Inconsistent in close matches (2-4 in deciding sets)<br>  <br>  <strong>Current window of opportunity:</strong> On any given day, he can have a flat match, particularly after a big result or when expected to win.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>8. Head-to-Head & Common Opponents</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Common Opponent Analysis:</strong> Based on available data:</li></ul><br>  - <strong>Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38):</strong> Max is 1-1 against him<br>    - Win: 6-4 6-4 (October 2025)<br>    - Loss: 6-4 0-6 [6-10] (September 2025)<br>    - <em>Pattern: Can beat RYBAK in straight sets but collapsed in deciding set when they played a month earlier</em><br><br><ul><li><strong>Style Matchup Insight:</strong> Based on match book notes, Max is described as:</li></ul><br>  1. High percentage first serves<br>  2. Big forehand<br>  3. All-court aggressive style<br>  <br>  <strong>If you are a counterpuncher or defensive baseliner:<em>* Max's aggressive style may work against him in extended rallies, particularly given his close-score struggles. His 2-4 record in deciding sets suggests he may overhit or force errors when matches extend. *</em>Current stylistic window of opportunity:</strong> Make him play one more ball, extend rallies, and test his patience.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>9. Momentum & Confidence Indicators</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Current Form (Last 10 Singles Matches):</strong> </li></ul><br>  - <strong>Record: 5-5</strong> (excluding walkovers)<br>  - Recent results:<br>    1. Loss to Cristobal PLASENCIA ROBLES (UTR: 11.46) - 3-6 2-6<br>    2. Loss to Dhakshish ARYAN (UTR: 11.68) - 3-6 4-6<br>    3. Win vs Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38) - 6-4 6-4<br>    4. Win vs Boden WILLIS (UTR: 10.26) - 6-3 6-1<br>    5. Win vs Joaquin BLANCO (UTR: 11.04) - 6-3 6-2<br>    6. Loss to James WAKEFIELD (UTR: 11.38) - 6-2 4-6 [9-11]<br>    7. Loss to Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38) - 6-4 0-6 [6-10]<br>    8. Win vs Aidan GIONIS (UTR: 9.87) - 6-2 6-4<br>    9. Loss to Rajat SHIRUR (UTR: 12.58) - 2-6 2-6<br>    10. Win vs Connor COLE (UTR: 11.14) - 3-6 6-4 [11-9]<br>  <br>  <strong>Current streak:</strong> 2-match losing streak entering his next event<br>  <br>  <strong>Momentum assessment:</strong> Neutral to slightly negative. He's splitting matches but losing to higher-rated opponents and struggling in close matches.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Recent Breakthroughs/Slumps:</strong></li></ul><br>  - <strong>Breakthrough:</strong> Win over Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38) on October 13 in straight sets—his best win in the dataset<br>  - <strong>Concerning pattern:</strong> Back-to-back losses at Evert ITF J60 and Naples consolation final to players rated 11.46-11.68 UTR in straight sets<br>  - <strong>Slump indicator:</strong> Lost to Andrew VINCLER (UTR: 10.78) and Carson KUCHAR (UTR: 10.91) in June—significant Upset Losses that may have affected confidence<br><br>---<br><br><h2>10. Weakness Identification</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Specific Current Vulnerabilities:</strong></li></ul><br>  1. <strong>Close-score/clutch situations:</strong> 2-4 in deciding sets and match tiebreaks (33%). Frequently loses after being competitive for two sets.<br>  2. <strong>Performance vs 11.5+ UTR:</strong> 0-5 record indicates a current ceiling he hasn't broken through.<br>  3. <strong>Consistency when favored:</strong> Upset Losses to VINCLER (UTR: 10.78) and KUCHAR (UTR: 10.91) show vulnerability against lower-rated opponents.<br>  4. <strong>Physical/mental stamina in long matches:</strong> Retirement vs NISSEN, multiple match tiebreak losses, and pattern of fading in third sets (0-6 third set vs RYBAK).<br><br><ul><li><strong>Red Flags:</strong></li></ul><br>  - <strong>6 walkovers</strong> in match history (mix of given and received) suggests scheduling or physical concerns<br>  - <strong>Retirement</strong> against NISSEN after splitting sets with a tiebreak<br>  - <strong>Third set collapses:</strong> 0-6 third set vs RYBAK, 0-3 retirement vs NISSEN, [4-10] vs CHOW, [6-10] vs RYBAK, [9-11] vs VINCLER and WAKEFIELD<br>  - <strong>Main draw struggles:</strong> 25% win rate in R32, 0% in R16<br><br><ul><li><strong>Top 2-3 Primary Current Vulnerabilities:</strong></li></ul><br>  1. <strong>Current close-score vulnerability (see Sections 1 and 9):</strong> 2-4 in deciding sets/match tiebreaks with multiple third-set collapses. This is the #1 exploitable weakness.<br>  2. <strong>Current vulnerability vs lower-rated opponents when favored (see Section 2):</strong> Upset Losses to VINCLER and KUCHAR demonstrate he can be beaten by players he should defeat on paper.<br>  3. <strong>Current level ceiling at 11.5 UTR (see Section 2):</strong> 0-5 vs 11.5+ opponents indicates he hasn't found a way to compete at the next level yet.<br><br>---<br><br><h2>11. Psychological Profile</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Mental Durability:<em>* Max shows *</em>current struggles with mental durability</strong> in extended matches:</li></ul><br>  - Third set record is poor with multiple collapses (0-6, 0-3 retirement, [4-10], [6-10])<br>  - Pattern of winning first set then losing focus/intensity (6-4 0-6 vs RYBAK, 7-5 6-7 [4-10] vs CHOW)<br>  - Match tiebreaks appear to be a particular pressure point (1-4 record)<br>  <br>  <strong>Current vulnerability:</strong> When matches extend past two sets, his performance typically deteriorates rather than improves.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Emotional Control:</strong> Based on match patterns:</li></ul><br>  - Shows current tendency to tighten in close-score situations<br>  - May experience frustration after losing a set he should have won (evidenced by 0-6 third sets)<br>  - Consolation bracket success (73%) vs main draw struggles (lower win rate) suggests <strong>current vulnerability to pressure/expectations</strong><br>  - The aggressive playing style noted in match book ("big forehand, all-court aggressive") combined with close-score struggles suggests he may force errors when stressed rather than staying patient<br><br>---<br><br><h2>12. Tactical Blueprint (The Game Plan)</h2><br><br><ul><li><strong>Primary Strategy:<em>* **Extend rallies and take him into a deciding set.** Max's 2-4 record in deciding sets and match tiebreaks is his most exploitable current weakness. His pattern of third-set collapses (0-6, [4-10], [6-10]) suggests that if you can stay competitive through two sets, the momentum often shifts. *</em>Do not panic if you lose the first set</strong>—his match vs Ivan RYBAK (UTR: 11.38) shows he's capable of winning set one 6-4 and then losing 0-6 in set three.</li><li><strong>Serve/Return Strategy:</strong></li></ul><br>  - <strong>On serve:</strong> Hold serve and avoid giving him easy break opportunities early. His match stats vs Francesco PADILLA (UTR: 8.59) show he's aggressive on return (12 return winners). Make him work for break points.<br>  - <strong>On return:</strong> Target his second serve aggressively. His match stats show a 56.7% second serve rate against PADILLA—if he's hitting that many second serves against weaker opponents, he may be vulnerable on second serve against peers. Look to be aggressive on second serve returns to build pressure.<br>  - <strong>Pattern:</strong> His "big forehand" strength means you should consider directing balls to his backhand in neutral rallies, particularly under pressure in close-score situations where he may overhit.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Rally Patterns:</strong></li></ul><br>  - <strong>Neutralize his aggression:</strong> His "all-court aggressive style" means he wants to dictate. Use depth and consistency to absorb his power and make him play extra balls.<br>  - <strong>Exploit backhand under pressure:</strong> Match stats show 7 backhand errors vs only 3 forehand errors against PADILLA. In tight moments, rally to his backhand.<br>  - <strong>Extend points:</strong> His close-score struggles suggest he may make errors when rallies extend. Don't try to out-hit him—out-grind him.<br>  - <strong>Target net approaches:</strong> His stats show 0 net errors but only 3 net winners—he's not a natural net player. Bring him forward with drop shots and passing shot opportunities.<br><br><ul><li><strong>How to Exploit Their Current Key Vulnerabilities:</strong></li></ul><br><br>  1. <strong>Exploiting Close-Score Vulnerability (Primary):</strong> <br>     - <strong>Stay in every point.</strong> His 2-4 deciding set record means you have a statistical advantage if you can get to a third set.<br>     - <strong>In tiebreaks:</strong> Play high-percentage tennis. His 1-4 match tiebreak record suggests he may go for too much. Let him make the errors.<br>     - <strong>Mental approach:</strong> If he wins the first set, don't panic. His pattern shows he often can't sustain intensity. If you win the first set, be ready for him to fight back in the second—but know the third set favors you statistically.<br><br>  2. <strong>Exploiting Vulnerability When Favored:</strong><br>     - <strong>Play with confidence.</strong> His Upset Losses to VINCLER (UTR: 10.78) and KUCHAR (UTR: 10.91) show he can be beaten by lower-rated players. Don't be intimidated by his ranking or UTR.<br>     - <strong>Make him feel the pressure of being expected to win.</strong> Stay competitive early, and the weight of expectations may affect him.<br><br>  3. <strong>Exploiting Level Ceiling:</strong><br>     - If your UTR is 11.5+, know that he's 0-5 against players at that level. <strong>Play your game with confidence</strong>—the data says he hasn't found a way to beat players at your level yet.<br>     - If your UTR is below his, his Upset Loss pattern shows he's beatable. <strong>Compete like you belong</strong>, and his current struggles in close matches give you a real chance.<br><br>---<br><br><strong>Summary:<em>* Max Freedman (UTR: 11.40) is a competitive player with an aggressive style and a big forehand, but his current data reveals significant vulnerabilities in close-score situations (2-4 in deciding sets), against higher-rated opponents (0-5 vs 11.5+ UTR), and even when favored (Upset Losses to 10.78 and 10.91 UTR opponents). The tactical blueprint is clear: *</em>extend matches, stay patient, and trust that if you can get to a deciding set, the statistics favor you.</strong> His third-set collapses and match tiebreak struggles represent the primary current window of opportunity. Be ready to fight, stay composed in pressure moments, and let his current close-score vulnerability work in your favor.
