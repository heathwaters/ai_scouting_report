    ## Additional Meaningful Data Points & Pattern Analysis
    
    After analyzing the existing scouting report structure and available data sources, here are additional meaningful insights that can be extracted:
    
    ### Ranking Inflation/Deflation Analysis
    
    - **National Ranking vs. UTR/WTN Discrepancy Index:** Calculate variance between national ranking percentile and UTR/WTN percentile to identify players who may be over/underrated in specific systems. A player ranked 500th nationally but with a UTR in the 300th percentile range indicates potential ranking inflation through selective play.
    - **Opponent Quality Score:** Aggregate the average UTR/WTN of all opponents faced vs. their national rankings to determine if a player is strategically playing up or down in competition level.
    - **Rating Velocity Discrepancy:** Compare the rate of change in national ranking vs. UTR/WTN over time periods. Divergent trajectories may indicate gaming of one system or tournament selection strategy.
    
    ### Competition Selection & Strategic Play Patterns
    
    - **Tournament Tier Distribution:** Analyze what percentage of matches are played at International, National, Regional, Local, or Sectional levels to understand competitive ambition and strategic tournament selection.
    - **Geographic Competition Radius:** Map where opponents are from to identify if player stays local (potentially avoiding tougher competition) or travels widely (seeking stronger competition).
    - **Draw Position Advantage Rate:** Track if player consistently draws lower-seeded opponents in early rounds, which could indicate strategic entry timing or point manipulation.
    - **Bye & Walkover Rate:** High rates may indicate point accumulation without actual competitive play.
    
    ### Advanced Performance Metrics
    
    - **Close Match Performance Index:** Win/loss record in matches decided by tiebreaks or third sets to measure clutch performance ability.
    - **Upset Rate (Both Directions):** Frequency of beating higher-rated players vs. losing to lower-rated players to assess consistency and ceiling.
    - **Surface Transition Adaptability:** Performance variance when switching between surfaces within short time periods.
    - **Competition Density Impact:** Performance correlation with number of matches played in consecutive days/weeks (fatigue factor).
    - **Serve Hold Rate by Set Position:** Serving performance in first set vs. second set vs. third set to identify physical/mental patterns.
    - **Return Game Aggression Index:** Break point conversion rate and return game winners-to-errors ratio.
    
    ### Temporal & Situational Intelligence
    
    - **Time-of-Day Performance Variance:** If match times are available, identify morning vs. afternoon vs. evening performance patterns.
    - **Weather Impact Correlation:** If weather data is available, correlate temperature, humidity, and wind with performance metrics.
    - **Rest Days Optimal Window:** Identify if player performs better with 1, 2, 3+ days of rest between matches.
    - **Tournament Week Position Performance:** Does player start strong and fade, or start slow and improve as tournament progresses?
    - **Match Duration Tolerance:** Win rate in matches
    
    ### Opponent Quality & Performance Level Analysis
    
    - **Average Win Threshold Metrics:** Calculate the average national ranking, UTR, and WTN of opponents this player defeats to establish their typical "win ceiling." This reveals the competitive level at which they consistently succeed.
    - **Average Loss Threshold Metrics:** Calculate the average national ranking, UTR, and WTN of opponents this player loses to, establishing their "loss floor." This identifies the competitive level where they struggle.
    - **Competitive Range Index:** The gap between win threshold and loss threshold metrics indicates consistency. A narrow gap suggests predictable performance; a wide gap indicates inconsistency or match-up dependency.
    - **Rating System Performance Comparison:** Compare win/loss thresholds across all three rating systems (national ranking, UTR, WTN) to identify if player performs differently against opponents rated highly in one system vs. another.
    - **Opponent Quality Trend Analysis:** Track whether the average rating of opponents beaten/lost to is increasing or decreasing over time, indicating competitive trajectory and ambition level.
    
    ### Consolation Draw (FIC) Performance Analysis
    
    - **Main Draw vs. Consolation Draw Win Rate Differential:** Compare win percentage in main draws vs. consolation (FIC) draws to measure mental resilience and fight after adversity.
    - **Consolation Draw Commitment Score:** Track completion rate of consolation draws (do they withdraw or play through) and average performance quality to assess competitiveness after losing.
    - **Bounce-Back Performance Index:** Measure performance in first consolation match immediately following main draw loss to gauge mental recovery speed.
    - **Consolation Draw Opponent Quality:** Analyze if player's performance in consolation differs when facing higher vs. lower rated opponents, revealing if they "mail it in" or use it as development opportunity.
    - **Point Recovery Strategy via Consolation:** Calculate average points gained through consolation play to identify players who strategically use back draws for ranking maintenance vs. those who skip them.
