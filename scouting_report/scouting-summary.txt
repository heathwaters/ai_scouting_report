This page outlines a comprehensive AI integration project for the MTA (Match Tennis App) platform focused on creating advanced AI-powered scouting reports for tennis players. The system will analyze USTA Player Record data to generate detailed competitive intelligence reports covering performance analytics, competition level analysis, rating trajectories, surface preferences, point defense strategies, temporal patterns, and predictive metrics. Key features include automated push notifications for point expiration (30, 14, and 7 days prior), a global initiative with revenue sharing for tennis organizations via Stripe integration, and the ability for users to collect and store opponent data in a "black book" for future AI analysis. The AI will process data from multiple sources including USTA Player Records (match results, rankings, UTR/WTN ratings, tournament levels, surfaces, points earned), ranking snapshots explaining the USTA Points Per Round (PPR) system, player match statistics, and user-generated tactical notes. The system aims to democratize professional-level scouting by providing 12+ categories of analysis ranging from win/loss patterns and opponent quality assessment to momentum indicators and vulnerability identification, with confidence scoring based on data recency, match count, and statistical availability.
