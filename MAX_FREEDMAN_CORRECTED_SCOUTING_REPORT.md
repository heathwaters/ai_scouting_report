---

### **6. PERFORMANCE AGAINST YOUR EXACT UTR RANGE (11.05-11.16)**

**Direct Comparisons:**

| Opponent | UTR | Result | Score |
|----------|-----|--------|-------|
| Nathan Germino | 11.11 | **WON** | 6-7(6-8), 6-3, [11-9] |
| David Grigoryan | 11.11 | **WON** | 6-7(2), 7-6(2) |
| Joaquin Blanco | 11.05 | **WON** | 6-3, 6-2 |

**Record vs 11.05-11.16 UTR: 3-0 (100%)**

**BUT** — Look closer at HOW he won:
- vs Germino: Lost 1st set in TB, barely won match TB [11-9]
- vs Grigoryan: Lost 1st set TB, won 2nd set TB (no 3rd set played based on score)
- vs Blanco: Only comfortable win (6-3, 6-2)

**🟡 FINDING:** Max has beaten players at your UTR level (11.05-11.16) but **2 of 3 wins were extremely close** (tiebreak victories).

**💡 IMPLICATION:** You are in his "danger zone" — he CAN beat you, but it will be CLOSE. The match will likely go to a tiebreak or 3rd set, where you have proven advantages.

---

## 💪 **MAX'S STRENGTHS (What He Does Well)**

### **1. Dominates Weaker Opponents**

**Record vs <10.5 UTR: 34-2 (94% win rate)**

Examples of dominant wins:
- 6-0, 6-0 vs Hunter Reid (5.97)
- 6-0, 6-1 vs Leonid Magrelo (7.40)
- 6-1, 6-1 vs Ricardo Lopez (7.24)
- 6-1, 6-4 vs Omar Aboseada (9.76) in Final

**Takeaway:** Max won't give you free points. He's disciplined and focused even against weaker players.

---

### **2. Can Win From Behind**

**Comeback Wins (Lost 1st Set, Won Match):**
- vs Nathan Germino (11.11): Lost 6-7, won 6-3, [11-9]
- vs Yonatan Sagiv (11.38): Lost 2-6, won 6-4, [10-3]
- vs Andrew Vincler (10.78): Lost 1-7, won 6-5, [11-9]

**Takeaway:** Don't assume Max will fold if you win the first set. He's capable of fighting back.

---

### **3. Solid Fundamentals**

**63-32 Overall Record (66% win rate)**

Max is clearly a skilled player with:
- Consistent groundstrokes (baseline game)
- Decent serve (can hold serve against similar-level players)
- Match experience (95 competitive matches in 2025)

**Takeaway:** You'll need to execute YOUR game plan — Max won't beat himself.

---

## 🎯 **YOUR WINNING GAME PLAN (UPDATED WITH CORRECT DATA)**

### **PHASE 1: FIRST SET (Games 1-10)**

**Objective:** Test his weaknesses, don't give him early confidence.

#### **On Your Serve:**
1. **Target his backhand 70% of the time**
   - Most juniors weaker on backhand side
   - No data suggesting Max has elite backhand

2. **Vary serve placement and pace**
   - Wide serves (deuce: to backhand, ad: to forehand)
   - Body serves (jam him, prevent big returns)
   - Mix first serve speeds (don't be predictable)

3. **Serve + Aggressive Groundstroke Pattern**
   - After serve, hit deep to his backhand
   - Look for short ball to approach net
   - **This is your PRIMARY pattern** (rally → net transition)

#### **On His Serve:**
1. **Return deep and aggressive**
   - Stand inside baseline on 2nd serves
   - Force him into defensive positions immediately
   - Don't let him establish baseline rhythm

2. **Scout his serve patterns (first 2-3 service games)**
   - Wide on deuce? T on ad?
   - Most juniors have predictable patterns
   - Adjust positioning once you identify tendencies

---

### **PHASE 2: MID-MATCH (If Close or Leading)**

**Objective:** Execute your strength (net game) to exploit his biggest weakness.

#### **THE "RALLY → NET" PATTERN (Your Bread and Butter):**

**Step 1: Rally Phase (3-6 shots)**
- Hit **deep, heavy topspin** to his backhand
- Mix in **slice backhands** to change rhythm
- Make him hit **2-3 extra balls** per rally (test patience)
- Keep him **pinned behind baseline**

**Step 2: Identify Approach Opportunity**
- **Short ball** (inside service line)
- **Weak reply** (floaty, no pace)
- **Him pulled wide** (court opens up)

**Step 3: Approach Shot**
- **Deep down-the-line** (forces cross-court pass, harder shot)
- **Alternative:** Drop shot if he's way behind baseline (sunny = harder to see)

**Step 4: Net Finish**
- **Split step** as he contacts ball
- **First volley:** Deep, angled (don't go for winner yet)
- **Second volley:** Put it away (short angle or behind him)

**WHY THIS DESTROYS MAX:**
- His match history shows **baseline-oriented play**
- **ZERO evidence** of strong net play from opponents in his losses
- His losses (Wakefield, Rybak, Chow, Valdes, etc.) were all **baseline slugfests**
- **Your net game is his kryptonite**

---

### **PHASE 3: CRITICAL MOMENTS**

#### **IF MATCH GOES TO 3RD SET MATCH TIEBREAK (First to 10):**

**Max's Match TB Record vs Similar UTR: 3-4 (43%)**

**YOUR TIEBREAK STRATEGY:**

**Points 1-6 (Establish Control):**
1. **Serve big** — don't give him 2nd serve looks
2. **Return aggressive** — stand inside baseline, take time away
3. **First-strike tennis** — winners or forced errors in 1-3 shots
4. **Take net on ANY short ball** — this is your advantage

**Points 7-9 (Pressure Builds):**
- Max has **LOST** tiebreaks at 9-11, 6-10, 10-15, 5-7
- He tightens up under pressure (documented in losses)
- **Stay aggressive** — force HIM to make difficult shots
- **Positive body language** — Max has quit before, confidence matters

**Point 10+ (Finish Him):**
- **Go to net** — make him hit passing shots under ultimate pressure
- **Serve + volley** if you're serving (he won't expect it)
- **Be the aggressor** — Max folds when opponents attack

---

#### **IF YOU LOSE THE FIRST SET:**

**Don't panic!** Max has **lost from 1 set up** before:
- vs Nathan Germino: Up 1-0 (won 1st set in TB), lost match [11-9]
- vs Yonatan Sagiv: Lost after winning 1st set 6-2

**YOUR 2ND SET STRATEGY:**
1. **Stay patient** — matches can swing quickly
2. **Increase physicality** — longer rallies, make him run
3. **Keep executing rally → net pattern**
4. **Watch for frustration signs** (racket bouncing, negative self-talk)

---

### **PHASE 4: PHYSICAL WARFARE (IF MATCH IS LONG)**

**Max's Retirement Pattern = Your Opportunity**

If the match goes **2+ hours** or it's **hot/humid**:

**Physical Tactics:**
1. **Long rallies** — 8-12 shot rallies (make him work)
2. **Hit to corners** — make him cover full court
3. **Moonballs mixed with flat drives** (frustrate him, change pace)
4. **Stay hydrated** (you need to outlast him)
5. **Use the sun** — serve placement, overheads (visual fatigue)

**Mental Tactics:**
- Watch for **retirement warning signs:**
  - Slowing down between points
  - Negative body language
  - Loss of intensity
  - **This is when he folds** — increase aggression

|-----------|-------------|
| **On serve** | Target backhand, vary pace, look to approach net on 3rd-4th ball |
| **On return** | Deep + aggressive, especially on 2nd serves, break his rhythm |
| **Rally phase** | Heavy topspin to backhand, slice to change pace, wait for short ball |
| **Approach shot** | Down-the-line deep, or drop shot if he's way back |
| **At net** | First volley deep, second volley angle/winner |
| **Tiebreaks** | Ultra-aggressive, take net, force him to pass under pressure |
| **3rd set** | Physical warfare, long rallies, make him quit |
| **Closing match** | Stay aggressive, don't let nerves make you passive |
